ABOUT:
This project seeks to use ML to train a model to play Galaga reasonably well.

IMPORTANT:
The code found under the /src/emulator/mame folder IS NOT MY OWN!! I am using the MAME emulator (https://github.com/mamedev/mame) under the terms of its license simply to run the Galaga game. My ML program should work on any Galaga game--knock on wood--but it has been optimized for this emulated version.
